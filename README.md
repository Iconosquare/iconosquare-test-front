# Test Front - React

### Instructions

- Once completed, share us your repository

### Tasks

You have to do some tasks on a graph and a table which are a simulation of a live stream of events that refreshes every 2s. 

- Clicking on a cell makes it editable and allows to edit its value.
- The chart must show the correct value.
- Clicking on the chart may open the cell `value1` of the corresponding event

### Bonus

- A button may be added to reset all the updated values.
- Add some components in the UI that allow to navigate in time.
